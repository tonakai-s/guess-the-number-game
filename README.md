# guess-the-number-game

A little program that I maked alone using the C language.
I'm learning about the fundamentals of the languagem when I maked this games, and helped me a lot.

It generate a random number, and of course, user have a limited times of trys.
I implemented some ways to handle error on the input, and inform to user if the random number is less or grater then the informed number.

Thanks for looking!
